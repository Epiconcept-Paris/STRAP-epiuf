path to the shared drive

\description{
Quick way to find the path to the root Shared Drive (e.g., "G:/Shared drive").
It will identify the letter associated to the Drive (e.g., D:, G:, etc)
and then the name of the root folder (i.e., "Shared drive" or "Drive partag√©").
Indeed, depending on the user language, it could be labelled in english or French.
Only these tow languages are implemented so far.
